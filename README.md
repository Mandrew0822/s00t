# TODO
  - Add compile optiom to output executable
  - loop

All of the things one the TODO list are more tedious, so they may take awhile, if they're even attempted in the first place.


# SYNTAX

1. START/END
  - These two statements will start and end the program respectively. Forgetting the END statement will cause the program to hand as it has no defined end.
Example:

        START
        (code goes here)
        END


2.> "    "
  - This is a print statement that will display a set string
Example:

        START
        > "Hello, s00t!"
        END
